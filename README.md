## Install

We support building open source software personally for security and comfort reasons. Although this is an option, we also have prebuilt installers available on our [Releases](https://github.com/AKKPP/ChessCoinWeb-Browser/releases) page.

## Bugs, Support and Chat

For bug reports, support, and just having a friendly chat with the team, feel free to join the discord at https://discord.gg/APy2TXKDVZ or create an issue on the GitHub repository.

## Goals

- Minimalist ui that feels more native than firefox's (custom skin, not a rewrite)
- Replace some internal firefox components with better open source alternatives (e.g. uBlock origin)
- Remove mozilla's telemetry, ads and pocket
